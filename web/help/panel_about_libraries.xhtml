                Often to test an issue one needs to experiment with different library versions and compare.
                This is quite easily done with this mini NetBeans web app.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>
                    This particular mini web app deliberately does not use Maven. This is the most 
                    basic Ant-based NetBeans web app project type
                    designed to be used completely offline and without any Maven setup.
                    (Maven is however a very cool thing, and a Maven-based version might also be offered later too.)
                </em>
            </p>

            <p>
                By default this web app will use the Mojarra JSF implementation of your web app server
                (Glassfish or Payara). To run against a specific Mojarra (or other JSF implementation) version:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There are some Mojarra versions already under the <code>./lib</code> folder 
                        for you to choose from, or, if you need to test against another version:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Download a Mojarra implementation JAR 
                                <a href="https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/releases/org/glassfish/javax.faces/" target="_blank">from the Glassfish Maven repository</a> 
                                (you don't need Maven) and place the clearly named and versioned 
                                <code>javax.faces-[version].jar</code>
                                in the <code>./lib</code> folder of this project (do not over-write your 
                                server's version, as it may impact on other JSF web applications, and it's tedious).
                            </li>
                        </ul>                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assign it from the NetBeans IDE <em>Projects</em> window from the <b>Libraries</b> 
                        node for your project
                        by right clicking and using just <b>Add JAR</b> (not as a full NetBeans Library)
                        and <b>use the relative path</b> option.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="nb">Then uncomment BOTH LINES indicated in the <code>glassfish-web.xml</code> to <b><code>useBundledJsf</code></b>.</span>
                    </li>   
                    <li>
                        Clean and Build then Run; the <code>common</code> header will show you whether it caught the new version.
                    </li>   
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                To run a specific PrimeFaces version:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can directly download 
                        <a href="https://www.primefaces.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Community Edition JARs for Primefaces from the main PrimeFaces site</a> 
                        (you may have to scroll down a bit), or ELITE and PRO versions if you are a subscribed customer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place a clearly named and versioned <code>primefaces-[version].jar</code> in the <code>./lib</code> folder of this project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the <em>Projects</em> window under the <b>Libraries</b> node for your project 
                        you might have to remove any existing PrimeFaces jar library assignment.
                        (It won't delete the actual JAR from the <code>./lib</code>, it just un-assigns it.)
                    </li>
                    <li>                        
                        Assign the new one from the <em>Projects</em> window from the <b>Libraries</b> node 
                        for your project by right clicking and using just <b>Add JAR</b> 
                        (not as a full NetBeans Library) and <b>use the relative path</b> option.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clean and Build then Run; the <code>common</code> header will show you whether it caught the new version.
                    </li>   
                </ul>
