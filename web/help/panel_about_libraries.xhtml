                Often to test an issue one needs to experiment with different library versions and compare.
                This is quite easily done with this mini NetBeans web app.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>
                    This particular mini web app deliberately does not use Maven. This is the most 
                    basic Ant-based NetBeans web app project type
                    designed to be used completely offline and without any Maven setup.
                    (Maven is however a very cool thing, and a Maven-based version might also be offered later too.)
                </em>
            </p>

            <p>
                By default this web app will use the Mojarra JSF implementation of your web app server
                (Glassfish or Payara). To run against a specific Mojarra (or other JSF implementation) version:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Download a Mojarra implementation JAR <a href="https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/releases/org/glassfish/javax.faces/" target="_blank">from the Glassfish Maven repository</a> (you don't need Maven).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place a clearly named and versioned <code>javax.faces-[version].jar</code> in the <code>./lib</code> folder of this project (do not over-write your server's version, as it may impact on other JSF web applications, and it's tedious).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assign it from the NetBeans IDE Projects window from the <b>Libraries</b> node for this project
                        by right clicking and using just <b>Add JAR</b> (not as a full NetBeans Library)
                        and <b>use the relative path</b> option.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="nb">Then uncomment BOTH LINES indicated in the <code>glassfish-web.xml</code> to <b><code>useBundledJsf</code></b>.</span>
                    </li>   
                    <li>
                        Clean and build then run; the header will show you whether it caught the new version.
                    </li>   
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                To run a specific Primefaces version:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can directly download 
                        <a href="https://www.primefaces.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Community Edition JARs for Primefaces from the main Primeface site</a> 
                        (you may have to scroll down a bit), 
                        or ELITE and PRO versions if you are a subscribed customer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place a clearly named and versioned <code>primefaces-[version].jar</code> in the <code>./lib</code> folder of this project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the Projects window under the <b>Libraries</b> node for this project 
                        you might have to remove any existing Primefaces jar library assignment.
                        (It won't delete the actual JAR from the <code>./lib</code>, it just un-assigns it.)
                    </li>
                    <li>                        
                        Assign the new one from the NetBeans Projects window from the <b>Libraries</b> node 
                        for this project
                        by right clicking and using just <b>Add JAR</b> (not as a full NetBeans Library)
                        and <b>use the relative path</b> option.                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clean and build then run; the header will show you whether it caught the new version.
                    </li>   
                </ul>
            </p>
